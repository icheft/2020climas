Big shout out to Project Zeppelin and the developers behind it. You can visit the original repo [here](https://github.com/gdg-x/zeppelin). For a quick demo, please visit <http://gdg-x.github.io/zeppelin/>.

### About
Project Zeppelin allows you to setup awesome GDG DevFest site in 5 minutes.

Project is built on top of [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) - simple, blog-aware, static site generator. Jekyll also happens to be the engine behind GitHub Pages, which means you can use Jekyll to host your website from GitHub’s servers for free. [Learn more about Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/).

Template is brought by [GDG Lviv](http://lviv.gdg.org.ua/) team.
