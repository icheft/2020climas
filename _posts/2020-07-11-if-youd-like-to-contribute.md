**想說的話** workspace needs your decorations!

2020 CLIMAS Camp will be held 11-13th of September in Taichung. If you want to be part of this amazing event but don't know how, here is one way to do it. Every one of you, including the organizers and students from all over Taiwan (the world), can submit your very own work to me at [brian.lxchen@gmail.com](mailto:brian.lxchen@gmail.com). Behold, please see the instructions or otherwise, I might not be able to receive your work.

#### How to Submit Your Blog Post?

First and foremost, I prefer you using `markdown`. If you can send me a link to your `markdown` post on [hackmd.io](https://hackmd.io/?nav=overview), I'd be so much appreciated.

But never mind if you have no idea what I just wrote. If you want to contribute to the website or want to be part of the fam, the following is where you should be focused on.

1. Compose your documents in any platform you like, it can be `Word`, `Pages`, or any text editors.
2. Write an email titled `[CLIMAS 徵稿] <你的文章標題> | <姓名, 職稱>`.
3. Attach your work in the email.
4. Click `send`.

So for example, this post can be sent to me in the following format:
```txt
To: brian.lxchen@gmail.com
Title: [CLIMAS 徵稿] If You'd Like to Contribute... | Brian Chen, 資管二
Content: 
  Dear Brian,

  사랑해 and the attachment is my sincere work that I wish to be put on the website.

  Much Love and Many Thanks,
  Brian
```

Easy, eh?
